📊 Data Visualization in Python — Case Study
📌 Overview
This case study focuses on exploring and visualizing app store data using Python. The objective is to understand trends, patterns, and relationships in app characteristics such as ratings, installs, genres, Android versions, and content categories through visual analytics.

The notebook demonstrates how data visualization can support better insights and decision-making by transforming raw data into meaningful graphical representations.

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas — Data cleaning and analysis
Matplotlib — Basic plotting
Seaborn — Statistical visualizations
NumPy — Numerical operations
